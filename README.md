DFS for searching and backtracking for finding shortest path.
Animated solution with timeout so you can see how it solves.
It does this from recieving the stack of nodes and then reverses the list of them and pops.
Same with optimal solution it recieves the list of nodes and reverses them and pops.

Using depth first search to solve randomly generated mazes - DSA
